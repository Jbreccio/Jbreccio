## 🔥 Projetos em destaque

👉 [Network Security Tools](https://github.com/Jbreccio/mini-central-hacking)  
This project aims to transform a TV Box with RK3229 chipset into a portable hacking center, running the Armbian system and several security tools, including Metasploit, Burp Suite, Hashcat, among others. The system is protected by a presence sensor integrated into the Astronaut Sensor Detector, which, when detecting suspicious movements, activates a series of security measures.

👉 [Bakery Management System](https://github.com/Jbreccio/bakery-management-system)  
Complex management system, similar to the IFood APP, with 9-layer security to be applied in bakeries, supermarkets, mini markets, businesses such as stores, made with Python and Node.js
