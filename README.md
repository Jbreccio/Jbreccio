👉 [Mini Central Hacking](https://github.com/Jbreccio/mini-central-hacking)  
This project aims to transform a TV Box with RK3229 chipset into a portable hacking center, running the Armbian system and several security tools, including Metasploit, Burp Suite, Hashcat, among others. The system is protected by a presence sensor integrated into the Magali doll, which, when detecting suspicious movements, activates a series of security measures.
